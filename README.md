📌 Project Overview

Paylance is a role-based, milestone-driven freelancer payment platform designed to create a secure, transparent, and collaborative freelancing ecosystem.
The platform allows clients to post projects with predefined milestones and budgets, while freelancers apply by submitting mandatory demo projects for evaluation.

To ensure trust and security, Paylance follows a milestone-based escrow payment system, where funds are released only after client approval.
Real-time chat and automated email notifications enhance communication throughout the project lifecycle.
